 * The creator, as one entity rather than three copies of a description.

 * This site emitted a Person node in three places, and they had already drifted:
 * the one on /about/ carried a job title, an employer and three sameAs links;
 * the one in the same file's AboutPage carried a name and a URL and nothing
 * else. To a crawler that is not one person described twice, it is two people
 * who happen to share a name — and the whole point of an entity graph is that
 * the machine can tell those apart.
 *
 * So: described once, referenced everywhere, from a single definition here.
 *
 * `sameAs` is the part that does the work. It is how a knowledge graph decides
 * that the Krishna Chagti on this site is the Krishna Chagti it already knows
 * about, and it is corroboration rather than assertion — every URL in it is a
 * profile that can be fetched and checked back. That is also why it is short.
 * Four identifiers that resolve and agree beat a dozen that cannot be verified,
 * and a sameAs pointing somewhere unverifiable is the one way this markup could
 * actively mislead rather than merely fail.
 *
 * ORCID earns its place: it is a persistent identifier issued by a body whose
 * whole function is saying that a name refers to one specific human. Its record
 * was fetched and it names Krishna Chagti with a researcher URL pointing back at
 * conyso.com, so the link is reciprocal — which is exactly the property that
 * makes an identity claim checkable.
 *
 * No Wikidata item exists for this person. When one does, its QID belongs at the
 * top of this list; it is the strongest single bridge into a knowledge graph and
 * nothing else here substitutes for it.
 *
 * NOTE, carried over from the fork checklist: the Person node is kept because it
 * is true — the same human made this. The *Organization* node is not, because
 * whether this site is a Conyso property has not been decided. Asserting a
 * publisher that has not agreed to be one is the one thing in this file that
 * could actively mislead a knowledge graph rather than merely say nothing.

 * six lines of inline-free JS in common.js. Nothing is loaded from anywhere,
 * nothing is counted, and the row works with the page's own stylesheet.

 * approximation of somebody's trademark is both a worse mark and a wronger one,
 * and the site's rule against inventing things does not stop at prose.
 *
 * Order is deliberate. Native share first where the device has it (on a phone

 * because the readers most likely to pass an entry on are pasting it into a
 * document, an issue or a wiki, not into a timeline.
