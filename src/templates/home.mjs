// The layout is The Law Tome's hero, class for class, because styles.css came
// from there: `.hero`, `.hero-mark`, `.eyebrow`, `.lede`, `.hero-hook`, `.orn`,
// `.stmt-wrap`, `.hero-actions`. Reproducing the names is what gets the design.
//
// Two things this page has learned the hard way and should not forget.
//
// The first draft was written for an empty corpus, and keeping it bare was
// right then: rendering the shape of a finished encyclopedia around nothing is
// a lie told in layout. It then stayed bare after entries landed, which is the
// worse mistake — a visitor met a count, a button, and none of the entries.
// So the rule is not "stay small"; it is that every section says something true
// about what exists, including the thing itself once anything does.
//
// The second: the eyebrow makes a claim about scale, and this site does not
// have scale. It says what is measured instead, and the numbers in it come from
// the corpus rather than from ambition.
