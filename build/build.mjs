// The whole build. Renders every page into dist/, then writes the files that
// describe the site to machines: robots, sitemap, manifest, share card, CNAME.
//
// Deliberately one short file. The site it was forked from grew a 1,153-line
// orchestrator emitting 36 page types, and that was earned one page at a time;
// starting from the finished size would mean carrying the complexity of thirty
// five page types that do not exist yet.
//
// Ordering that matters, and why:
//
//   1. Every page is rendered with LASTMOD_TOKEN where its date goes.
//   2. The pages are hashed WITH the hole still in them, and compared against
//      the committed manifest to decide which dates move.
//   3. Only then is the token replaced and the bytes written.
//
// Doing it in any other order folds today's date into the hash, so every page
// differs from yesterday and the sitemap goes back to claiming the whole site
// changed this morning. See build/lastmod.mjs for the argument.
